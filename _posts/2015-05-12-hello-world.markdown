So I just started this blog, my intention is to write mostly about my side
projects and random thoughts. Posts here will be a mix of a personal and technical blog.
I want to be able to write about anything without fear of it not being useful
enough for general public.

For example this post is completely useless. Here's a picture of my cat.
