You might not know this but I happen to live and work from Zagreb, Croatia. People here often complain about this and that, goverment, taxes, wanting to move to USA, or UK, or Germany or basically anywhere. If I decided to write a blog post about everything that sucks here and could be improved it would be a very long blog post. However, there are a lot of benefits of freelancing from Zagreb and I decided to be positive and write about those.

# Low prices
# Great community
# Safety
# English speaking
# Near European tech centers
