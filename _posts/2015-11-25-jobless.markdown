So I recently released [Jobless](https://github.com/dabrorius/jobless). Well, I released it a few months ago, and already held a lightning talk about it on [WebCamp Zagreb](https://2015.webcampzg.org/) but I didn’t write about it earlier.

So jobless is a DSL, written in Ruby, for generating CVs. I started working on it mainly out frustration with available tooling. I don’t like working with rich text editors, and writing an HTML/CSS document from scratch feels too cumbersome. I was also reading [Metaprogramming Ruby](https://pragprog.com/book/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby) at the time and wanted to try out some of the techniques mentioned there.

I won’t go in-depth about how to use Jobless, because it’s rather simple and I believe it’s described well enough on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/dabrorius/jobless). But here’s an example of working Jobless code so that you get the basic idea.

{% highlight ruby %}
Jobless.cv do
  name "John Doe"
  email "john.doe@gmail.com"

  employment do
    entry do
      title "Full-stack Rails developer"
      company "Royal Programming Squad"
      start_date "April 2015"
      end_date "June 2015"
    end
    entry do
      title "C# Developer"
      company "Microsoft"
      start_date "January 2015"
      end_date "April 2015"
    end
  end

  open_source do
    github_repo "dabrorius/jobless"
    github_repo "dabrorius/markov-noodles"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

So you just set your basic info, add employment, education
and other types of experience, compile the code and that's it.
I recently added github_repo keyword that automatically
fetches data about your project from a GitHub repository.

Original idea was to generate a HTML document and then convert it to PDF with something like [pdfkit](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit) or [wicked_pdf](https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf). 
This would allow the user to write custom CSS for their CV and still get a PDF version.
The problem is that they both depend on [wkhtmltopdf](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/wiki/Installing-WKHTMLTOPDF)
which is a C library. I felt like it would complicate the tool
too much, and I wanted Jobless to be super easy to install and use.

I ended up dropping the PDF support because you can easily convert HTML to PDF
using a browser. However, I recently noticed an issue with this approach. Browsers
tend to enter page breaks in your CV in worst possible places. There's a [CSS
attribute](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_print_pagebi.asp) that should prevent this but it doesn't really work, browsers just ignore it.

I like the idea of having HTML as a base version because it's easy to override
the default style by the user but the problem with converting to PDF is too annoying.
So the plan is to release a new version of Jobless that will be generating a
PDF directly. [Prawn](http://prawnpdf.org/) is, unlike HTML to PDF conversion gems, pure Ruby, which is great.

I'm still not sure when the new version will be released, but it is on my to-do list.
