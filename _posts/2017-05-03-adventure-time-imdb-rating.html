<p>
  This is a diagram showing IMDB rating for each <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time' target='_blank'>Adventure Time</a> episode in first seven seasons.
  Rating is expressed relative to the median IMDB rating for all Adventure Time episodes.
</p>
<p>
  Bars on the left side indicate rating is lower than the median, and bars on the right indicate that rating is higher than the median.
  Clicking on a bar will lead you to the IMDB page for that episode.
  Visualization was built using <a href='http://d3js.org/' target='_blank'>D3.js</a> and data was scraped with <a href='http://www.nokogiri.org/'>Nokogiri</a>.
</p>

  I had fun building this so enjoy it and stay mathematical!
