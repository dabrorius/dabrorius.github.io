Hello, my name is Filip Defar and I live in [Zagreb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb), Croatia.
I work as a Ruby developer, write stupid mobile apps and games, play drums in a godawful band and try to keep up to date with latest technologies. If you want to talk about something
feel free to send me an [email](mailto:filip.defar@gmail.com).
