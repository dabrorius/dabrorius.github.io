Being a software developer is often portraited as a dream job
that everyone should strive for. I guess that somebody saw a few developers
and though: "Oh they look really happy, if anybody else did the same
thing they would be happy too!". If just more people had the same opportunities and
and privilege they would certanly become a developer too, and then they would
be happy too, right?

There's just one problem. Developing software [sucks](http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks)!
It's extremely difficult and stressfull, and requires extreme amount of time and
effort to learn.

Honstley, it is still a dream job for me. And it is a dream job for a lot of other
people. We love it so much that we would do it even if they didn't pay
us. And most of us did it for free for a long time before our career started
and still do a lot of recreational programming.

It's actually similar to S&M, it's fun and pleasurable, but only if you are
really into it! Otherwise it's just somebody beating the shit out of you while
you are tied up.

An often asked question is: "Why are there so little females in tech industry?".
I believe that the real question should be "Why
are there so many males doing this to themselves?". Honestly, I have no idea. Nobody
should be willing to deal with kind of crap we deal with every day, let alone
to be happy doing it. Software developers are masochists.
