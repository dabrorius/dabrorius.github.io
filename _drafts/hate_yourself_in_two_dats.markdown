# We will teach you how to hate yourself in just two days!
I have voulonteered as a mentor in one (and thankfully only) horror of self-esteem crushing
workshop named [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com/). It is intended to teach
girls of any age and any background how to create a Rails application in just
two sessions. It's total of around 6 hours of work if I remember correctly.

Let me repeat that for you, they promised to teach people who have never in
 their life seen HTML, CSS or any programming language,
have no understanding what a database is, what HTTP server is or how to use
command line to write web applications in rails in 6 hours.

Long stroy short, everyone I talked to afterwards have felt incredibly stupid
because they couldn't even begin to grasp any of the concepts in such short time.
I tried to explain them that it's a skill that takes years just to learn the basics,
but I believe that a lot of them gave up on programming that day.

# Programming is not easy and fun
Programming is not any more fun then running a marathon. Telling people that it is
won't do any good. Even developers tend to forget how much effort they have put
in to learn everything they know.
