How a webcam can save your team

I've been freelancing for over 3 years now, and have worked with a lot of
different teams. Each of them had different process.

One thing I noticed is that I loved working more and would burn out less with
teams that used their web camps during daily stands (hint: the requirement is
to have daily stands).

It's easy to fall into a routine where you sit and just sovle tickets one by one
feeling like a code generating machine. Startups talk about passion all the time,
but it's hard to inspire developers with a list of chores that need to be done
ASAP.
